First of all I want to congratulate you all for making this decision to add such a skill to your various number of skills, as been able to interpret data is a skill that is very much in increasing demand with the vast amount of data been created nowadays.\n",

    "As you may have noticed and I mentioned in our class, I am not using the typical IDE where you write long code with lots of comments in-between, rather I am using something called Jupyter notebooks. As the name implies, it is actually a notebook where you can make notes like I am here and also write and run code as well in cell blocks. I believe this notebook is very good especially for beginners in Python because you can break your code into multiple bits and test each part seperately so that way even debugging your code becomes easier. This notebooks also becomes good for us Data Analysts/Scientists because you can make valid notes and deductions from your analysis and that way present it to your client or stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain this Jupyter notebooks there are two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can download and install Anaconda which is a good navigator made for data scientists and comes will all the packages installed, plus it is easier to work with, though it can be quite heavy.\n",
    "2. Alternatively (not sure if this english is correctüòÇ), on visual studio code, there is an extension called Jupyter which has been added and enables you to actually have juypter notebook run on your VS code making everything much easier (God bless Microsoftüôå)\n",
    "\n",
    "I strongly advise you to get this Jupyter notebook as that is what I will be using for the duration of the course and notes like this will be in them making it easier for you to interact with my notes.\n",

    "This game is your usual rock paper scissors game, but it will been between the a user and the computer. The user will input their choice and the computer will randomly choose a value and the two values will be compared and a decision will be made on who wins and if its a draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "To consider:\n",
    "- use of input to take in user's choice\n",
    "- research and use of random module\n",
    "- use of conditionals - if, elif, else and while statement\n",
    "- functions to break your code into bits (optional)\n",

    "#### X and O game\n",
    "This game will be set to be between 2 players. You will need to start by printing the board along the positions of the board and for every position selected by a player, you should print the board with that position filled and at the same time check the whole to see if the condition required for the a player to win is met and when the whole board is filled and no one wins, it should be set as a draw\n",

    "This is a simple game where the computer chooses a random number (can be set between a range of numbers), the player then picks a number and the program checks if it matches the random number selected. If the number a player chooses is less than the random number, then the player will be told that, same thing goes for if it number the players picks is higher. After a certain number of times if the player does not win, then its Game Over!!!\n",
